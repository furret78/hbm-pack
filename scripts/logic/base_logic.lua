-- this is the file to put all your custom logic functions into.
-- if you dont want to use the json based logic you can switch to a graph-based logic method.
-- the needed functions for that are in `/scripts/logic/graph_logic/logic_main.lua`.



-- function <name> (<parameters if needed>)
--     <actual code>
--     <indentations are just for readability>
